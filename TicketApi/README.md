# Exercise: Web Applications & Architecture

## Objective
A demonstration of your ability to write source code to requirements supported by high level
documentation to explain the fundamentals of the given solution. We will be analyzing the
implementation both at the architecture and code levels for elegance, maintainability, scalability,
adherence to industry standards, and extensibility.

## Technologies
Your solution should be buildable and cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac).  
At a minimum, please leverage the following for this exercise:  
 - Angular or ReactJS – with TypeScript
 - .NET Core – with C#

 ## Business Ask
 Build a Helpdesk support ticketing web application to satisfy these user stories:  

- **User Story:** As a User, I can log in and out of the system.
- **User Story:** As a Helpdesk User, I can create a support ticket.
- **User Story:** As a Helpdesk User, I can view all of my support tickets.
- **User Story:** As a Helpdesk Team Member, I can view all support tickets.
- **User Story:** As a Helpdesk Team Member, I can update any support ticket.

*Note: Interpret these requirements as you see fit. Less focus should be placed on the UX design. The structure of your solution is most important.*

## Next Steps
When you’ve completed the above user stories, update your README with the following:  
- Steps required to build, run, and test the solution locally
- Any assumptions you’ve made about the requirements
- Explanation of major components and configuration
